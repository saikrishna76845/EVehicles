            <h2>What are Electric Vehicles?</h2>
            <p>
                Electric Vehicles (EVs) are vehicles that use electric motors powered by batteries instead of
                traditional internal combustion engines. They are considered a cleaner alternative to conventional
                vehicles, as they produce no direct emissions and are more energy-efficient.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="how-it-works">
            <h2>How Do Electric Vehicles Work?</h2>
            <p>
                Electric vehicles operate using an electric motor that gets its power from a battery pack. The battery
                is charged through an external power source, such as a charging station or a home outlet. When the
                driver presses the accelerator, the motor draws electricity from the battery to power the wheels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike gasoline-powered vehicles, EVs do not require fuel combustion. Instead, they use an electric
                motor to directly convert energy into motion, offering higher efficiency and reduced environmental
                impact.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="benefits">
            <h2>Benefits of Electric Vehicles</h2>
            <p>Zero emissions: EVs produce no tailpipe emissions, reducing air pollution.</p>
            <p>Energy efficiency: Electric motors convert more energy from the battery into movement compared to
                internal
                combustion engines.</p>
            <p> Lower operating costs: EVs are generally cheaper to maintain due to fewer moving parts and no need for
                oil
                changes.</p>
            <p> Quiet operation: EVs operate much more quietly than traditional vehicles, reducing noise pollution.</p>
            <p>Government incentives: Many governments offer tax credits and subsidies for purchasing electric vehicles.

            <h2>The Future of Electric Vehicles</h2>
            <p>
                As technology advances, electric vehicles are becoming more affordable and accessible to the general
                public. With improvements in battery technology, charging infrastructure, and the development of more
                efficient electric motors, EVs are expected to become the standard mode of transportation in the near
                future.
            </p>
            <p>
                The transition to electric vehicles is expected to play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions
                and combating climate change.
